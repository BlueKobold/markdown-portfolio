# More emphasis on my awsomeness

### Task
Write out some of your awesome attributes, and use emphasis (like bold or italics) to identify keywords, programming languages, or skills. 

How do you know how awsome I am?
Anyway, yeah, I am __handsome__, __sexy__ and __rich__. _What more do I need to say?_ :DDD
Ah, sure, my _smartness_ even tops my _wealth_ and of course my _altruism_ helps a lot with my _sex addiction_ not to forget my _narcism_ is maybe a little pushed by my _adonic body_.

## Oh and last but not least some programming languages:

  - `HTML` (Yes, this is not a programming language, but anyway)
  - `CSS` (Yes, see above ^^^)
  - `JavaScript` (somehow you have to)
  - `PHP` (helps a lot)
  - `Python` (of course, I wear a beard)
